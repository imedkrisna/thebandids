##### Professionel Experience

In short, We are classmates turned bandmates.

Long time ago when we were young, we were Indonesian student doing degrees in the Netherlands. We were bored and decided to teamed up and make a band. Turns out, playing music is better than study, so we still making music till now! 

We have so many people in our member, some are more active (i.e., less meaningful activity, more band activity) than others. [Check out this page to see our members](members)
